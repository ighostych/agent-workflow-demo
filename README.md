# Agent Workflow Demo

This repository demonstrates using GitHub issues as the primary workspace for AI agent collaboration.

## The Pattern

```
Chat (ephemeral) → Issue (persistent) → Comments (iteration) → Commits (linked) → PR (closes issue)
```

## Why This Works

1. **Ideas persist** — Issues survive session ends
2. **Full traceability** — From proposal to implementation, everything is linked
3. **Async collaboration** — No need for real-time chat for deep work
4. **Searchable history** — Future reference for "why did we do it this way?"

## Example

See [#1](../../issues/1) for the original RFC that created this repo structure.
